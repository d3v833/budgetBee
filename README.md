# Budget App - Budgety_bee

## A project from @JonasSchmedtman's "The Comlete JavaScript Course"

I added my own styling - "Budget bee". This project taught me how plan and think about building an app.

### Step 1: Identify the fundemental things the budget app needs to do

- Take in input of numbers and strings
- List the income & expenses inputs
- Do some +/- calculations and give expense percentage
- update totals

### Step 2: Create a TO-DO-LIST

1. Add event handler
2. Get input values
3. Add the new item to our data structure
4. Add the new item to the UI
5. Calculate budget
6. Update UI - delete / write

### Step 3: Plan the projects structure - Break tasks into modules

1. UI Module

   - Get input values
   - Add the new item to the UI
   - Update the UI

2. Data Module

   - Add the new item to our data structure
   - Calculate budget

3. Controller Module
   - Add event handler

### Step 4: Create a high-level diagram of your project

Keep a running visual / flow-chart of how the modules and functions. This high-level overview will help with the planning and structuring of the app as you write code.

### Step 5: Final touches - Work on additional features and styling

Once the main purpose of the app is working, start styling and working on the features.

### What's Next?

Finish his course then rework this into a react or flutter app.
